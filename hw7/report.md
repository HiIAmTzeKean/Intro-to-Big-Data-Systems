## Answer

Gabriel argues that the success of software is often due to its simplicity and ease of implementation, rather than its correctness, consistency, and completeness. He calls this the "worse is better" philosophy, and he contrasts it with the "right thing" philosophy, which prioritizes correctness and other quality attributes over simplicity.

Gabriel argues that the "worse is better" philosophy has several advantages. First, it makes it easier to get software up and running quickly. Second, it makes it easier to port software to new platforms. Third, it makes it easier to improve software over time. Some examples are Unix and C.

However, Gabriel also acknowledges that the "worse is better" philosophy has its drawbacks. One drawback is that it can lead to the development of software that is buggy, difficult to maintain, and not very user-friendly. Another drawback is that it can be difficult to convince users to switch to a new software system, especially if it is not as powerful or feature-rich as existing systems.

Gabriel concludes by arguing that the best approach to software development depends on the specific needs of the project. He suggests that developers should consider both the "worse is better" and "right thing" philosophies when making design decisions. He uses the example of developing AI software with C which is a arduous task.
